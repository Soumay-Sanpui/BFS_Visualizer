BFS Visualizer 🚀
=================

Overview ℹ️
-----------

Welcome to the BFS Visualizer! This tool demonstrates the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm in action, helping you understand how this fundamental graph traversal algorithm works.

BFS is commonly used to explore nodes in a graph or tree structure, finding the shortest path between a starting point and a target point. In this visualizer, you'll see how BFS efficiently traverses a grid-based layout to find the shortest path from a source node to a destination node.

Features and Functionality 🛠️
------------------------------

### Interactive Grid 📊

*   Mark cells as walls by right-clicking, influencing the pathfinding process.
*   Randomly generated source and destination nodes with distinct icons.

### Animation and Traversal 🚶‍♂️

*   Animated BFS algorithm traversal, highlighting explored nodes.
*   Visualization of the shortest path once the destination node is reached.

### Getting Started 🏃‍♂️

1. Clone the repository
  ```

  git clone https://github.com/Soumay-Sanpui/BFS_Visualizer

  ```

2. Head over to the cloned folder on your machine.
3. start the live server or run the ```index.html```
4. Learn and enjoy how BFS works under the hood with some amazing animations.
   
How to Use 📝
-------------

1.  Click the "Start Visualizer" button to initiate the BFS algorithm.
2.  Add walls to the grid by right-clicking on cells.
3.  Observe the algorithm's traversal and the shortest path found.
